The "Shopping Cart using Java" project showcases a practical implementation of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, providing an engaging experience with user input and product handling. 
The application is divided into modules focusing on Electronics and Home Appliances.

The Electronics module, represented by the ElectronicsApp class, incorporates a user-friendly interface to explore electronic products. Utilizing the Scanner class for input, it prompts users to 
select products like smartphones, laptops, or other gadgets, enabling them to view details and make purchases.

On the other hand, the Home Appliances module, managed through the HomeAppliancesApp class, employs similar functionalities, facilitating the exploration and purchase of appliances like kettles, 
vacuum cleaners, irons, and more. This section illustrates the seamless interaction with users, enabling them to browse through various products and make informed purchase decisions.

Each product within these modules is encapsulated within its respective class (e.g., Kettle or Iron), emphasizing the principles of encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance in OOP. 
The user can view product details such as brand, cost, color, capacity, and voltage, reinforcing the application's robustness in handling diverse product information.

The main class, ShoppingCartApp, orchestrates the execution of both Electronics and Home Appliances modules, demonstrating the modularity and scalability of the system. 
This structure enables the expansion of the shopping cart to include additional categories seamlessly.
